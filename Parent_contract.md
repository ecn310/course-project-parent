Charter Contract (Part B)
• We, the team named **Parents** agree with the information
documented in our team charter, and will try out best to uphold this charter. By signing below, we
indicate our commitment to our team. The group is expected to demonstrate positive cohesive
teamwork while developing and presenting this assignment. All members of the group are to make
equal efforts for the success of the group presentation. All group members are to fulfill the
responsibilities of completing the assignment and making strong efforts for success related to group role
expectations.
For the next several weeks, I will participate effectively in this group and strive to do the following;
• Come to class or group meetings on time (If I miss a group meeting, I will inform the group members
ahead of time).
• Come prepared to share with my group (If I am unable to prepare for the meeting or a portion of the
assignment, I will make up additional work according to the group needs).
• Listen actively to what others have to contribute (If I appear to not listen, my group peers can ask me to
focus and pay attention).
• Be supportive of the efforts and initiatives of others (If I am too critical, my group peers can point this
out and ask me to soften my approach).
• Be respectful at all times (If I demonstrate disrespectful behaviour, my group members have the right to
ask me to stop).

Divorce Claus:
• The group leader will determine if each member of the group is meeting their individual obligation, and
may warn the member(s) of poor contributions. When a group member(s) continuously causes group
dysfunction, the leader and offending member(s) must meet with the teacher. When a group
member(s) chooses not to meet the minimum expectations of positive group cohesion, that member(s)
will receive a grade of 0 (zero) for the group presentation and be removed from the group. The teacher
has the final decision making responsibility for group divorce.
