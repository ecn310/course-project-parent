\section{Research Question} \label{sec:question}

Do parents invest more time in their kids in U.S. counties where there is more inequality and/or less intergenerational mobility?

\section{Data Overview} \label{sec:literature}

Contains data from \textbf{762} communities across the U.S. Focuses on household income at age \textbf{35} for individuals who grew up in low-income families.

\subsection{Data Set 1 (Household income of the lower 25 percentile at the age of 35)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the source of the data? Opportunity Atlas a credible source and a collaboration between Harvard, Brown, and the U.S. Census Bureau
  \item How was it generated? Some possibilities: Did someone do a survey? Do people submit their own information? Did an organization compile it from public reports? 
  \item What is the coverage of the data? 762 counties throughout the United States
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What years? from 2014-2015
        \item What kind of observations (countries? individual survey respondents? etc) Each row is a county within the United States
        \item Scope (e.g., if countries, only developed countries?) United States
    \end{itemize}
  \item Number of variables
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Types of variables,  (is this dataset giving mainly economic indicators for a country? Is it reporting details about 911 calls?
    \end{itemize}
  \item How many observations total? (e.g., 20 countries with 10 variables each, for a total of 100 observations)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Set 2 (insert a descriptive title)}

If you have more than one dataset, answer all the same questions as in the previous subsection in a new subsection for each dataset. \\

\noindent If you only have one dataset, delete this subsection. \\

\noindent If you have two datasets, answer all the same questions as in the previous subsection for the second dataset.

\section{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:theory}

Explain how someone can acquire each dataset (you may need to use subsections again).
\begin{itemize}
    \item This should be in EXCRUCIATING detail: every click someone has to execute to get the dataset as you have it
\end{itemize}

\noindent Where have YOU stored the data? Include link(s).
\begin{itemize}
    \item If in a different location, where is your code and documentation?
\end{itemize}


\section{Data Manipulation}
\label{sec:data}

What steps have you taken / do you plan to take to get the data ready for analysis? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Examples: checking for outliers; dropping some observations you don't need; investigating something you've already noticed that doesn't make sense.
    \item If you've already done some work, where are the files and documentation for that work?
\end{itemize}

\section{Linking Datasets}
\label{sec:discussion}

How you will link different data sets together (if you'll need to)
\begin{itemize}
    \item What variable(s) in each dataset will you use to merge the datasets together?
    \item Example: We will merge Dataset A with GDP for each country with Dataset B that has manufacturing employment for each country across years. In Dataset A, these variables are called \textit{year} and \emph{country}; Dataset B calls the year variable \emph{yr} and the country variable \emph{name}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Key Variables}
\label{sec:result}

List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis, separately for each dataset
